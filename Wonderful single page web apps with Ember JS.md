* Intro about Ember

**Definitions**
* What are models?
* What is the router?
* What are controllers?
* What are views?


**Ember Concepts**
* Nested routes to represent nested UIs
* Naming conventions


**Building an app for real**
* let's design our app architecture
* let’s set up our model with ember-data's fixtureAdapter
* let's read our model datas with a dynamic route
* let’s edit the datas 
* let’s create a new record
* let’s delete a record
* we still need to fix some little quirks
* deploy for real with the restAdapter


**Let’s add some beauty**
* bind a class which contains a css animation to a view
* use a property to represent a state and bind classNames 
* load a CSS animations collection file if you hate CSS
* you can use jQuery in your views with the didInsertElement hook


**What else?**
* precompile your handlebars templates
* format the datas from within the templates with handlebars helpers
* use ember without ember-data
